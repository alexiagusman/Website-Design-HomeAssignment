                    Makeup has a rich and diverse history that spans across different cultures and centuries.

                    Throughout history, makeup trends evolved, influenced by cultural shifts and societal norms.
                    In the Middle Ages, a fair complexion was highly prized, and women used substances like lead-based powders to achieve a pale look.
                    The Renaissance period saw a return to more natural aesthetics, with an emphasis on clear skin and delicate features.
