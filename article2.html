                    The first computer programmer in history is often considered to be Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer.
                    She wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, specifically Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, in the mid-19th century.

                    The term "bug" in the context of computer programming has an interesting origin. In 1947, Grace Hopper,
                     an American computer scientist, found an actual moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer.
                     She removed the moth and documented it in the logbook, coining the term "debugging" to describe the process of fixing computer glitches.
