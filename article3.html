                    Swimming is a low-impact exercise, making it gentle on joints and suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.
                    The buoyancy of water reduces the impact on bones and joints, making it an ideal exercise for those with arthritis, joint pain, or mobility issues.
                    Additionally, swimming helps improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, flexibility, and overall endurance.
